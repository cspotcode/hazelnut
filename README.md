Why
---

- Well, because **Hazelnut is 325 bytes gzipped.**
- Almond is bigger than it needs to be if you're just using it as a shim.
- The name `hazelnut` was available on [npm](https://npmjs.com)
- Now we can all compete to see who can come up with the smallest implementation _(submit a pull request)_


---


Usage
-----

Instead of passing `{ almond:true }` to Require Optimizer or adding almond to your concatenated source, just prepend `hazelnut`.
